**Unit 1: Origins of Quantum Theory** <span id="1"></span> 

*Quantum mechanics originated in the late nineteenth century, when
classical physics dramatically failed to explain certain experimental
results.  The three main experimental observations that could not be
explained by classical physics include phenomena related to the
blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, and the emission of
atomic spectra.  Although physicists initially tried to patch up
classical theory, it gradually became clear that new ideas were
necessary.  In this unit, you will learn in details about the origins of
quantum mechanics.*
