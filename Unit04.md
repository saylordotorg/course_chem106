**Unit 4: Quantum Chemistry: Atomic Structure and Spectra** <span
id="4"></span> 

*In this unit, you will start to apply quantum mechanics to solve real
chemistry problems, thus finally approaching quantum chemistry.  Your
studies will begin with the simplest system, the hydrogen-like atoms (or
ions), which is comprised by a nuclei and a single electron orbiting
around it.  As additional electrons enter the system under study, the
wavefunction describing the system will become more complex, and you
will use approximation techniques to simplify your calculations.  You
will discover how a particular atomic structure results in a
well-defined ground state electronic configuration.  This electronic
configuration is responsible for the atom photon absorption and emission
spectra, as well as its ionization energy, electron affinity, and
degenerate energy levels.*
