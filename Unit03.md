**Unit 3: Practical Problems in Quantum Mechanics** <span
id="3"></span> 

*In this unit, you will begin to use the equations and principles of
quantum mechanics to solve some simple problems, involving relatively
simple mathematics.  Although the examples presented here involve mostly
“imaginary” particles in ideal quantum systems, these examples will
serve as an introduction to quantum mechanical calculations.  The
principles learned using these ideal systems (e.g., particle in a box)
can be used later in “real” systems (molecules).  As the system under
study becomes more and more complex, you will learn how to adopt certain
techniques of approximation to simplify your calculation and still
obtain fairly accurate results.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 16.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 6 hours

    problem.
