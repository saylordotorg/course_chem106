**Unit 7: Spectroscopy I: Rotational and Vibrational Spectra** <span
id="7"></span> 
*This is the first unit of the spectroscopy portion of the course.  When
electromagnetic waves interact with matter, the outcome of the
interaction depends on both the nature of the molecule and the frequency
of the interacting light.  Infrared (IR) light usually causes atoms
within a molecule to vibrate and/or rotate.  In this unit, you will
learn how to correlate the electronic structure of molecules and their
symmetry to vibrational and rotational phenomena.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 18 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.1: 6 hours
