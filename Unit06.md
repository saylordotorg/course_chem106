**Unit 6: Symmetry in Molecular Structures** <span id="6"></span> 
*In order to better understand the spectroscopy portion of this course
(Units 7–9), you need to learn about molecular symmetry and some point
group theory.  Symmetrical molecules behave very differently with
respect to unsymmetrical ones when it comes to interaction with light.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 9 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.3: 2 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   List and explain the symmetry elements.
-   Apply the symmetry to wavefunctions.
-   Compute mathematical operations involving symmetry elements and
    wavefunctions.
-   Identify the symmetry in molecular structures.
-   Assign symmetry labels using character tables.
