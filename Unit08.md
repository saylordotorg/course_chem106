**Unit 8: Spectroscopy II: Electronic Transitions** <span
id="8"></span> 
*The previous unit dealt with IR causing rotational and vibrational
phenomena within a molecule.  In this unit, you will learn what happens
when a more energetic radiation, such as ultraviolet or visible (UV-Vis)
light interact with molecules.  UV-Vis light possesses sufficient energy
to cause electronic transition.  During an electronic transition,
electrons jump from their (low-energy) ground state configuration into a
high-energy excited state.  The excited electrons then find their way
back to the ground state, and here some interesting phenomena might
occur, such as fluorescence and phosphorescence.  Some direct
applications of electronic transitions include LASERs.*
