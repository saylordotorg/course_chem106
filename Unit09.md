**Unit 9: Spectroscopy III: Magnetic Resonance** <span id="9"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about the interaction of matter with
certain radio frequencies in the presence of a magnetic field.  These
frequencies can be absorbed and re-emitted by the nuclei or electrons,
resulting in unique spectra that correlate with the structure of
interacting molecules.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 16 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.1: 6 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.2: 5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.3: 5 hours

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe the scientific principle at the base of magnetic resonance
    spectroscopy.
-   Explain how spectra of nuclear magnetic resonance originate and list
    their applications.
-   Explain how spectra of electron spin resonance originate and list
    their applications.
