**Unit 2: Principles of Quantum Theory** <span id="2"></span> 

*In the classical world, Newton’s laws and laws of conservation of
energy are used daily to predict the outcome of certain events.  For
instance, the trajectory of a cannonball can be predicted with good
accuracy, given certain parameters such as the shooting angle, mass of
the cannonball, air resistance, and so forth.  In the world of quantum
mechanics, where objects possess very small masses and move at high
speeds, the Schrodinger equation is used to predict the behavior of a
system comprised of quantum mechanical particles (electrons, nuclei,
etc.).  Unlikely in classical mechanics, where the outcomes of the
calculations are undoubtedly clear (for instance, the cannon ball will
hit the ground at a precise coordinate point), the results of the
Schrodinger equation gives the probability of an event to occur.  In the
quantum world, for a given set of parameters, a large number of events
can occur, and the Schrodinger equation will predict the probability
that such events will happen, given a distribution of results rather
than a single answer.  In this unit, you will encounter the Schrodinger
equation for the first time.*
