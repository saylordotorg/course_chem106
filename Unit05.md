**Unit 5: Quantum Chemistry: Molecular Structure** <span id="5"></span> 
*In our daily life, only certain rare gasses exist as single atoms
(e.g., helium, etc).  The matter and materials we deal with everyday are
mainly in their molecular (e.g., plastics or gasoline), crystalline
(salt), or metallic (aluminum cans) state.  In these states, atoms of
one or more elements combine to form larger molecules, crystals, and so
forth.  In this unit, you will start to go over techniques of quantum
chemistry designed to study large molecular systems.  Of course, you
will start from simple models, such as the H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>
molecule-ion and the H<sub>2</sub> molecule.  Bonds will initially be
described in terms of Valence Bond Theory before approaching the
Molecular Orbital Model.*

    Huckel Approximation, Hartree-Fock method, and Density Functional
    Theory.
