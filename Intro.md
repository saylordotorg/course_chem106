Physical Chemistry II is quite different from Physical Chemistry I.  In
this second semester of the Physical Chemistry course, you will study
the principles and laws of quantum mechanics as well as the interaction
between matter and electromagnetic waves.  During the late 19th century
and early 20th century, scientists opened new frontiers in the
understanding of matter at the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic scale.
 These studies resulted in the development of quantum physics, which
nowadays is still considered one of the greatest achievements of human
mind.  While present day quantum physics “zooms in” to look at subatomic
particles, quantum chemistry “zooms out” to look at large molecular
systems in order to theoretically understand their physical and chemical
properties.  Quantum chemistry has created certain “tools” (or
computational methods) based on the laws of quantum mechanics that make
it theoretically possible to understand how electrons and atomic nuclei
interact with each other to form any kind of matter, ranging from
diamond crystals to DNA strands to proteins to plastic polymers.  Using
these tools, quantum chemists can simulate complex biological systems,
such as nucleic acids, proteins, and even cells, in order to understand
their functions and behavior.  These tools are increasingly used by
researchers at pharmaceutical companies as they need to simulate the
interaction of a potential drug molecule with the target receptor, such
as a protein binding pocket on the surface of a cell.  Scientists use
computational tools of quantum chemistry to predict the optical and
electronic properties of novel materials to be used in advanced
technologies, such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for solar energy
harvesting and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) for electronic
displays.  In these applications, scientists can “calculate” the range
of sunlight frequencies a certain material can absorb or the color of
the emitted light in a pixel fabricated using certain molecules. 
Quantum chemistry treats light as both a wave and a particle and uses
wavefunctions to describe systems composed by “tangible” matter, such as
electrons and nuclei.  A substantial portion of the course is dedicated
to the theoretical understanding of the interactions between light
(electromagnetic radiations) and matter (molecules, electrons, nuclei,
etc.).  These interactions are at the base of modern image techniques
used in the medical field, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
This senior course in quantum chemistry usually serves as an
introduction to more advanced graduate courses in theoretical chemistry,
rather than concluding your degree in chemistry.  With the knowledge
gained in this course, you will be able to calculate the energies of
simple systems, such as small molecules.  Keep in mind that these
calculations of quantum chemistry are fairly complicated, thus you will
learn several approximation techniques to aid your calculations of more
advanced molecular systems.  You will also be able to correlate the
outcome of your calculation to certain physical properties of the
molecule.  In particular, you will learn how the spectroscopy properties
are strictly interconnected with the electronic structure of molecules.

    Orbital Theories.

    interacting with matter.

-   Explain the effect of magnetic fields on electrons and nuclei.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course, you must:  
  
 √    Have access to a computer.  
  
 √    Have continuous broadband Internet access.  
  
 √    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins (e.g., Adobe
Reader or Flash) and software.  
  
 √    Have the ability to download and save files and documents to a
computer.  
  
 √    Have the ability to open Microsoft Office files and documents
(.doc, .ppt, .xls, etc.).  
  
 √    Have competency in the English language.  
  
 √    Have read the [Saylor Student
Handbook](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Saylor-StudentHandbook.pdf).  
  
 √    Have strong skills in mathematics.  Knowledge of using
computational software, such as MatLab or Mathematica, will greatly
facilitate your work and learning.  
  
 √    Have completed the following mathematics courses: multivariable
calculus ([MA103](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma103/)), linear algebra
([MA211](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma211/)), and differential
equations ([MA221](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma221/)).  Physical
Chemistry I ([CHEM105](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem105/)) is
conceptually very different from Physical Chemistry II (this course),
and the scientific concepts learned in Physical Chemistry I are not
necessary to understand Physical Chemistry II.  However, it is highly
recommended that you take
[CHEM105](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem105/) first, so you can
master the use of multivariable calculus (partial derivatives) to solve
chemistry problems.  Another important prerequisite that some students
in college take is calculus-based Physics-Classical Mechanics; the
Saylor Foundation offers the algebra-based equivalent of such a course:
[PHYS101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/phys101).  Engineering courses
such as
[ME102](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me102)/[ME202](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me202)
could complement PHYS101.

### Course Information

Welcome to CHEM106: Physical Chemistry II.  Below, please find some
general information about the course and its requirements.  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   [Everyscience.com](http://www.everyscience.com/Chemistry/Physical/index.html)
-   Macquarie University: Professor James Cresser’s [“Lecture
    Notes”](http://physics.mq.edu.au/~jcresser/)
-   Boston University: Professor Dan Dill’s [“Lecture
    Notes”](http://www.bu.edu/quantum/notes/QuantumMechanics/)
-   Southern Methodist University: Professor Werner Horsthemke’s
    [“Physical Chemistry II Lecture
    Notes”](http://faculty.smu.edu/whorsthe/pchem2.html)
-   Concordia College: Professor Darin J. Ulness’s [“Old Course
    Notes”](http://www.cord.edu/faculty/ulnessd/pchem/pchem.html)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units.  You will also need to complete:  

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the resources in this course.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **124.5
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and determine how much time you have over
the next few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 18 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a
total of 4 hours) on Monday night, subunit 1.2 (a total of 4 hours) on
Tuesday night, and so forth.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** As noted in the “Course Requirements,”
multivariable calculus ([MA103](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma103/))
is a prerequisite for this course.  If you are struggling with the
mathematics as you progress through this course, consider taking a break
to revisit MA103.
